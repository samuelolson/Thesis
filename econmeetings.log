09/29/16 - Met in Vollum 227

Summary:
-Talked about how I narrowed my search to how jobs are created in startups by looking
  at the network of individuals

Goals:
1. [DONE] Writeup proposal for funding for accessing Crunchbase, 1 pg., send to Noel
2. [DONE] Post onto Switchboard asking to speak with people working in startups (current & past)
3. Read up on literature, really focus on agglomeration and economies of scale
4. Ask Andrew about models (matrix of distances?) for network of individuals
